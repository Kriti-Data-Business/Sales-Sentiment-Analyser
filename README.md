# AI-Powered Pharmaceutical Sales Sentiment Analysis Platform
Implementation and stakeholder analysis of the Pharmaceutical Sales Sentiment Analyzer, a cutting-edge AI-powered solution that transforms sales communication analysis in the pharmaceutical industry


## Executive Summary

This project presents a sophisticated AI-driven sentiment analysis platform specifically designed for pharmaceutical sales teams, leveraging Claude Sonnet 4's advanced natural language processing capabilities to analyze sales representative communications across diverse healthcare stakeholder segments. The system provides actionable insights, risk assessments, and strategic recommendations to optimize pharmaceutical sales outcomes while ensuring regulatory compliance and relationship management excellence.

## Problem Statement

Pharmaceutical sales representatives engage with complex stakeholder ecosystems including physicians, hospital administrators, insurance providers, clinic managers, and retail customers. Each stakeholder type has distinct decision-making criteria, regulatory constraints, and communication preferences.
